"In mathematics, a subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, the sequence (A,B,D) is a subsequence of (A,B,C,D,E,F) obtained after removal of elements C, E, and F. The relation of one sequence being the subsequence of another is a preorder.
The subsequence should not be confused with substring (A,B,C,D) which can be derived from the above string (A,B,C,D,E,F) by deleting substring (E,F). The substring is a refinement of the subsequence.
The list of all subsequences for the word ""apple"" would be ""a"", ""ap"", ""al"", ""ae"", ""app"", ""apl"", ""ape"", ""ale"", ""appl"", ""appe"", ""aple"", ""apple"", ""p"", ""pp"", ""pl"", ""pe"", ""ppl"", ""ppe"", ""ple"", ""pple"", ""l"", ""le"", ""e"", """".

A happy number is defined by the following process:
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers.

An isogram (also known as a ""nonpattern word"") is a logological term for a word or phrase without a repeating letter.
